### Project Name
 Instant Inventory
### Overview
This application is meant to be a one stop shop for a buisiness not to showcase their products and have authenitcated users create wishlists of their items and doubles as a quick and easy inventory system. The Admin can add, edit, and delete their products being showcased to customers, as well as add, edit, and delete their Storefront and Warehouse indiviually. Each item show it's location in either the storefront or warehouse with a simple grid system. This grid is set by Aisle, Bay, and Level. 
### Personal Motivation
For a little over three years, I worked as a shipping coordinator for a company that shipped and recieved well of hundreds of thousands of items all accross North and South America. We were stuck with an archaic and extrememeley old, yet somehow complicated inventory sytem/database by the name of AS400. There was nothing easy with this system. This system was released in 1987 and our company insisted on never installing it's updates. This thing is clunky, delicate, and extremlely non user friendly. 
This inspired me to create an inventory system that is efficient and siple, that gets the job done. 

I also get insanley overwhelmed when shopping anywhere. By showing the storefront location of the items to the users, they can create a wishlist of these items and will nothave to spend time and energy looking over the store for their list.
